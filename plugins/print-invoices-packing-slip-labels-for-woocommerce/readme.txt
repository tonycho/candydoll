Generate and customise WooCommerce Invoice, Packing list, Delivery Note and Shipment Label for your orders.

== Description ==

= Introduction =

This plugin helps you generate Invoice, Packing List, Delivery Note and Shipment Label from the WooCommerce orders page. WooCommerce, by default, doesn't allow to print any of these documents from your orders page. Using this extension, you can very well streamline your online business.

= Why do you need Invoice, Packing List, etc? =

It is a good practice to include an invoice and packing list when you are shipping a package. It serves as a confirmation of what the package contains along with your contact information and the details of the purchase. 

When you sell internationally, it is a standard requirement in many countries to include an invoice. The Invoice should contain all the required order details such as name and address of your company, billing address of your customer, and a list of all order items including taxes and totals.

Furthermore, it establishes an extra line of communication between you and the customer and adds a human touch.
